PowerShell 7.0.0 Preview 5 and Microsoft.PowerShell.GraphicalTools Module Developed by The PowerShell Team over at Microsoft, Is what made me make  the Permanent switch to PowerShell Core and ditch the desktop version. My Module WinpeOutGridView is my first real module I wrote to come up with a real solution for what i was un able to find online. This module is servel solutions,  example 1. WinPE Out-GridView to Remove-WindowsDrivers, Remove-WindowsPackages Remove-AppxProvisionedPackages, Disable-WindowsFeatures.  example 2 Needed a way to display progress for AppxProvisionedPackages and  Remove-WindowsDrivers. Write-Progress ForEach-Object. With my module WinpeOutGridView and PowerShell Teams Mioft.PowerShell.GraphicalTools allows the user to select as many packages, drivers, appxprovisionedpackages,  windowsoptionalfeatures from a list a remove or disable with a few clicks and will display a progrcrosess bar with total number and current number in progress..'
